# SvelteKit skeleton project with TailwindCSS & postcss-nesting already added
I got annoyed of all the boilerplate setup I need to do when creating a new project, so I made this repo.

# Usage:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zsongli/sveltekit-tailwind-skeleton-project myproject
cd myproject
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```
